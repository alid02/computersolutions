          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>HOW WE STARTED & DEVELOPED OUR EMPHASIS ON IN HOUSE TRAINING – We’ve been helping people with their computers since 1999, when a young James Dickens went to work for Paul Kane and his friend Tom Gill in a new shop called “Computer Warehouse”, less because of it’s huge stock and more because of it’s warehouse like decor! We had a bench and a screw driver and people brought their problems to us. James was soon after made a junior partner with Tom and Paul and so it was for a few years. Unfortunately first Paul and then Tom spent less and less time in the shop due to ill health and eventually both Tom Gill & Paul Kane passed away. Without them there would be no Computer Solutions and they are fondly remembered. However the business they started with a hand painted sign and a screwdriver continued with James, who owes a huge debt to both Tom & Paul for giving him the chance early on. It is this emphasis on giving young technicians a chance to grow and gain experience from their seniors that has remained the bedrock for our company and it started with James learning from Tom and Paul.</p>
          <p>
          OUR PREMISES – As business grew, it allowed us to improve our premises and move into the larger shop next door  (we started in what is now the Art Cafe). We also realised we needed a new name to better express our service based model and so Computer Solutions (Winchester) Limited came into being in September of 2003 and we became established in our current corner shop with an expanded workshop downstairs to take on the workflow.  In our new premises our new larger custom fitted workshop allowed us to take on an apprentice and have two senior technicians, as well as trainee and part time staff, a system that has worked well for us for several years..</p>
